<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>I began my professional journey in 2015, starting in the BPO industry. Currently, I am working as a freelance web merchandiser for a retail company in Australia. In 9 years of working, I wear different hats, from customer service, Admin logistics, sales support, IT support, recruitment specialist and never thought I will end up doing product administrator job which I didn't expect that I will be good at.</p>

<p>With the current freelance job related to product merchandising, I started with the company doing full time as customer service , taking inbound calls, inbound chat and email, more of online product inquiry and online order follow-ups.</p>

<p>My previous tech experiences have mainly with small computer repair businesses and retail shops, focusing more on hands-on troubleshooting and face-to-face interactions with customers. In my free time, I dedicate myself in studying, reading tech blogs, participating in tech forums, and watching YouTube tech channels. This is my way of keeping myself updated on everything about tech.</p>
