<h3>Tech Experiences</h3>
<hr>
<p>
  In 2009, I successfully completed a two-year diploma program in computer technology,
where I gained a comprehensive understanding of various IT concepts and acquired
practical skills. Shortly after completing my course, I had the opportunity to work as an
IT assistant for a government organization in the Philippines. This role allowed me to
apply my knowledge and develop a deeper understanding of IT operations. </p>
<p>In the
following year, I was hired by a small business to work as a desktop/laptop technician
at a computer service center, where I gained valuable hands-on experience in
troubleshooting and resolving technical issues.</p>
<p>
During my initial job search, I encountered many employers who preferred candidates
with a 4-year degree in IT and experience in corporate organizations or large
companies. </p>

<p>This influenced my decision to explore other career paths, and I spent
several years working in customer service support roles in the corporate world.
Although these experiences have provided a solid foundation for my career, my passion
for computer technology has always remained strong, and I am now determined to
return to the technical field.</p>
